1. Monger uses MongoDB Java driver 3.x under the hood and thus supports MongoDB 2.2 and later versions.

2. In a document database such as MongoDB the smallest unit is a document. In MongoDB, documents are stored in a collection, 
which in turn make up a database. Document are analogous to rows in a SQL table, but there is one big difference: not every document 
needs to have the same structure—each of them can have different fields and that is a very useful feature in many situations. 
Another feature of MongoDB is that fields in a document can contain arrays and or sub-documents (sometimes called nested or embedded documents).

3. monger.collection/insert-and-return returns the exact documented inserted, including the generated document id.

4. monger.collection/insert-batch is a recommended way of inserting batches of documents (from tens to hundreds of thousands) because it is very
;; efficient compared to sequentially or even concurrently inserting documents one by one.


;; Document ids in MongoDB do not have to be of the object id type, they also can be strings, integers and any value you can store that MongoDB ;;
;; knows how to compare order (sort). However, using ObjectIds is usually a good idea.
